# Historical-Stock-Volatility

## Introduction:

Volatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. Volatility can either be measured by using the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index. Commonly, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. In other words, volatility refers to the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of changes in a security's value. A higher volatility means that a security's value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values. This means that the price of the security can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction. A lower volatility means that a security's value does not fluctuate dramatically, but changes in value at a steady pace over a period.

Historical volatility (HV) is the realized volatility of a financial instrument over a given period. Generally, this measure is calculated by determining the average deviation from the average price of a financial instrument in the given period. A lower volatility means that a company’s stock price does not fluctuate dramatically, but changes in value at a steady pace over a period. A higher volatility means that a company’s stock price can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values.

In this project, we collect 10 years’ data of daily prices of stock from January 2007 to December 2017. Then the collected data is cleaned and stored in a database then the cleaned data is retrieved and used to calculate the volatility of stock. Volatility could be calculated for any company from the Nasdaq list. Volatility is calculated for every year from 2007 to 2017.
